SAMSUNG RELEASES NEW MODEL

Samsung has once again proved to be one
of the best there is in the market.
--
The Galaxy S6 line retains similarities in design to previous models, but now uses a unibody metal frame with
a glass backing, a curved bezel with chamfered sides to improve grip, and the speaker grille was moved to the
bottom. The devices are available in "White Pearl", "Black Sapphire", and "Gold Platinum" color finishes; additional " Blue Topaz" and "Emerald Green" finishes are exclusive to the S6 and S6 Edge respectively. The S6 carries some regressions in its design over the S5; it is no longer waterproof, does not contain a MicroSD card slot, reverts to a USB 2.0 port from USB 3, and has a non-removable battery.
